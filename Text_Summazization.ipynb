We will get the real picture if we visit them again. Therefore, this ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ is, in a way, my own examination.

When they see the tangible results of their efforts, their enthusiasm multiplies. They feel satisfied. Therefore, ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ has had a positive impact on government officers. It has made them more enthusiastic about their work, especially when they witness the tangible benefits reaching the people. Officers now feel satisfied with their work, saying, “I made a good plan, I created a file, and the intended beneficiaries received the benefits.” When they find that the money has reached a poor widow under the Jeevan Jyoti scheme and it was a great help to her during her crisis, they realise that they have done a good job.

      "\n",
      "हमारे देश में, सरकारें आती हैं और जाती हैं, कई योजनाएं बनाई जाती हैं, चर्चाएं होती हैं, और बड़े वादे किए जाते हैं। लेकिन मेरी अनुभवों और दृष्टिकोण से मुझे यह प्रतीत होता है कि सबसे महत्वपूर्ण बात यह है कि सरकार की योजनाएं मंशित लाभार्थी तक पहुंचें बिना किसी परेशानी के। यदि 'प्रधानमंत्री आवास योजना' है, तो जो लोग झुग्गियों और झोंपड़ियों में रहते हैं, उन्हें उनका घर मिले। और उन्हें इसके लिए सरकारी दफ्तरों के चक्कर नहीं लगाने पड़ें। सरकार उन्हें पहुंचे।\n",

      "\n",
      "हमें यह जानने के लिए फिर से उन्हें देखना होगा। इसलिए, यह 'विकसित भारत संकल्प यात्रा' मेरी निरीक्षण है। मैं आपको और देशभर के लोगों से सुनना चाहता हूं कि मेरे द्वारा विचारित और किए जा रहे काम का क्या है और यह देशभर के लोगों के लिए वास्तव में क्या हो रहा है, और यह कि यह जो काम मैंने किया है वह जो लोगों के लिए है वह मंशित लाभार्थी तक पहुंच रहा है या नहीं।\n",
      "\n",
      "यह जरूरी है कि यह जांच की जाए कि जो काम होना था वह वास्तव में हुआ है या नहीं। हाल ही में मैंने कुछ व्यक्तियों से मिले थे जिन्होंने आयुष्मान कार्ड का उपयोग करके गंभीर बीमारियों के लिए उपचार प्राप्त किया था। एक व्यक्ति गंभीर दुर्घटना में घायल हुआ था और आयुष्मान कार्ड का उपयोग करके आवश्यक ऑपरेशन किया गया था, और अब वह ठीक हो रहा है। जब मैंने उनसे पूछा, तो उन्होंने कहा, \"मैं इस उपचार का कैसे खर्च कर सकता था? अब कि आयुष्मान कार्ड है, मैंने हिम्मत करके ऑपरेशन करवाया है और अब मैं पूरी तरह से ठीक हूं।\"\n",

      "आयुष्मान कार्ड के माध्यम से सरकारी अधिकारियों को भी संतुष्टि मिलती है क्योंकि वे जानते हैं कि उनके काम से किसी की जिंदगी में सकारात्मक प्रभाव पड़ रहा है। जब वे देखते हैं कि उनकी योजनाएं और काम सीधे लोगों के जीवन में सकारात्मक परिवर्तन ला रहे हैं, तो उनका उत्साह बढ़ जाता है। इसलिए, 'विकसित भारत संकल्प यात्रा' ने सरकारी अधिकारियों पर सकारात्मक प्रभाव डाला है और उन्हें अपने काम में अधिक उत्साहित बनाया है।\n",

      "\n",
      "सरकारी अधिकारियों के कुछ लोगों को यह समझने में मुश्किल होती है कि 'विकसित भारत संकल्प यात्रा' का क्या महत्व है। जब मैंने सरकारी कार्यालयों से जुड़े लोगों के साथ बात की, तो मुझे वास्तविक संतुष्टि मिली। उन्होंने मुझे बताया कि कैसे कोई व्यक्ति अचानक 2 लाख रुपये प्राप्त कर लेता है और एक भाई-बहन ने बताया कि गैस के आगमन ने उनके जीवन को बदल दिया है।\n",
